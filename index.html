          Hello! Welcome to Coffee Time, where I talk about my favorite coffee brewer, the AeroPress, and coffee. AeroPress is a simple, easy-to-use coffee maker that consistently brews better tasting coffee and espresso drinks. It’s an espresso maker, a drip coffee maker and a French press, all rolled into one!
        </p>
  
        <p>
          A rapid brewing process extracts the most flavor from your beans, giving you more rich, pure tasting coffee with no grit, no bitterness, and less acidity.

         Understand the science that makes AeroPress the best
        </p>
         AeroPress Original and AeroPress Go are immersion style coffee makers. Unlike the French press, finely ground coffee is immersed in the AeroPress chamber with a short brew time. The pressure produced when pressing the plunger through the chamber further extracts flavor, and coffee is free of mud and grit as it passes through a paper micro-filter.
        <p>
          (Grind) size does
  matter!
          <li>
            Grind size directly affects your coffee’s taste. A finer grind exposes more surface area to water, releasing more flavour and aroma compounds. A coarse grind has less surface area, making it harder for water to penetrate and extract these compounds. But beware: brewing with too fine a grind can make it very difficult to press.
          </li>
          <li>
  We recommend a medium to fine grind, depending on brew time. If you're pressing for longer than a minute, we suggest a coarser grind. If you’re pressing for 30 seconds or less, a finer grind is recommended. 
           </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          Water Temperature
          <li>
            We recommend 175°F (80°C) for hot coffee and room temperature for cold brew.

        Common mistakes when Breweing Aeropress Coffee
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              YOUR COFFEE ISN’T FRESH
                <p>
                  Right off the bat, the freshness of the coffee you use can and will make all the difference. Even if you opt for the highest-quality artisan coffee money can buy, it’s all for nothing if it isn’t fresh. Where possible, pick up beans in smaller batches that have only recently been roasted. At all times, only grind the exact amount you need for each cup you brew. Once you’ve tasted genuinely fresh coffee, there’s no going back.
                 </p>
              </li>
            <li>
              YOUR WATER QUALITY IS LOW
              <p>
                The quality of the water you use in your Aeropress will also make a big difference. There’s not a great deal you can do about the hardness or softness of the tap water in your area, but you can always switch to filtered or bottled water if the stuff that comes out of the tap isn’t particularly pleasant. Give it a try and you might be surprised how big of a difference it makes.
              </p>
              </li>
            <li>
              YOU’RE PRESSING TOO FAST OR SLOW
              <p>
                Generally it is recommended plunging your Aeropress for between 30 and 45 seconds. However, you’ll also find some people who enjoy coffee that comes from a 20 second press, or a 60 second press. There’s no right or wrong approach - it’s all about experimenting and seeing what works for you. In any case, it’s worth acknowledging the fact that the duration of the press will impact the flavour and consistency of the coffee.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              YOUR COFFEE ISN’T UP TO SCRATCH
              <p>
                For obvious reasons, you can’t expect even the most advanced Aeropress to transform low-quality coffee into a glorious cup. You’ll only ever get out what you’re willing to put in, so stick with the good stuff where possible.
                </p>
              </li>
            <li>
              YOUR GRIND CONSISTENCY IS OFF
              <p>
                Last but not least, the coarseness of the coffee grounds you use will also have a big impact on the flavour, fragrance and consistency of the resulting cup. Course grounds need more prolonged contact with the water for full extraction to take place, though finer grounds can result in a cup that looks and feels ‘muddy’ and bitter. Experiment with a good manual coffee grinder until you find the perfect coarseness for your taste.

      <article>
        <p>
         Be careful, hot liquids can cause serious burns
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Hold you mug and Aeropress chamber securely with one hand while pressing the plunger vertically down with your other hand. Ask others to stand back
        </p>
        <p>
          Never press if the seal is loose in the chamber. Hot water can shoot around the seal and burn you. If your seal is worn, go to <a href = "https://aeropress.com/collections/replacement-parts">aeropress.com </a> to order a replacement seal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never press into a fragile or narrow base cup. Use a sturdy mug.
          </p>
        <p>
          Never press hard. It can result in breakage and spills.
          </p>
        <p>
          Be extra careful when brewing using the inverted brewing method. It is less stable and therefore prone to tipping over and exposing the user to hot liquid.

      <header>Water Temperature</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Most people think good coffee is brewed in hot, hot water. But water that’s too hot can over-extract flavor compounds and release unfavorable flavors, such as bitterness and ash. However, brewing with water that isn't hot enough can result in under extraction, and sour, thin-tasting coffee. Cold extraction for cold brew is an exception to this rule because a long stir time and finer grind compensate for the lower water temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend 175°F (80°C) for hot coffee and room temperature for cold brew. 
       </p>
        <p>
          <b>HACK: </b>If you don't have a temperature controlled water kettle, let your water rest after boiling for one minute.

          <li>Steps:</li>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Measure and Grind</b></li>
            <p>Measure and grind 17g of coffee - on rounded AeroPress spoonful or about 2 1/2 Tablespoons. Grind the coffee about as fine as table salt.<p>
            <li><b>Prep the AeroPress</b></li>
            <p>Get the AeroPress ready to brew by placing the filter in the basket. Next, preheat the brewer and rinse the filter with hot water. This gets rid of any paper flavor and warms everything up. Heat up your mug with hot water while you’re at it.</p>
            <li><b>Add coffee</b></li>
            <p>Discard the rinse water from your mug. Affix the basket to the bottom of the brew chamber and place it on top of the mug. If it’s handy, use the funnel (or coffee loader) that comes with the AeroPress to add 17g of coffee. Then, remove the funnel.</p>
            <li><b>Add water</b></li>
            <p>Start your timer when you pour hot water (just off the boil or about 205°F) into your brewer. Saturate all the grounds within 10 seconds. Pour to the No. 4 or 220g of water if you’re using a scale. Spin the chamber, making sure all the coffee is saturated.</p>
            <li><b>Place plunger and wait</b></li>
            <p>Once you hit the No. 4, stir the “slurry” (coffee and water mixture) and place the plunger on the brew chamber and pull up slightly to create a pressure seal. Don’t plunge yet!</p>
            <li><b>Stir and plunge</b></li>
            <p>At 1:15, remove the pressure seal and give the slurry another stir with a spoon or paddle. Put the plunger back on and gently press down with steady pressure, stopping as soon as you hear a hissing sound. This entire brew process should take just under two minutes and yield seven to eight ounces of coffee.</p>
            <li><b>Clean and enjoy</b></li>
            <p>The AeroPress is easy to clean. Simply take off the basket and pop out the coffee grounds and filter. Clean the rubber plunger with hot kettle water and you’re ready for your next brew.</p>
